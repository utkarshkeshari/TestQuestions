# iris_pred.to_csv("/code/iris_prediction.csv")





Instructions to be followed

Read the training dataset
Train the K-Nearest Neighbour  model to predict output for given data
You are restricted to use K-Nearest Neighbour only.
Read the test data set from the given location
Predict the output for test dataset
You should assign the class 1 if the output probability of prediction is greater than 0.5 else 0 (use ifelse).
Output the prediction with respect to each id given in test dataset.
The final output file should contain only two columns one for Id and other prediction and should be named as 'Id' and 'Occupancy'
